# HtDP
Welcome to the HtDP repository! This repository contains the R and Rcpp code to reproduce the results in the paper "Dirichelt Process Mixture Models using Matrix-Generalized Half-t Distribution".

To get started, navigate to the code folder and run the code_modeling.R file. All the analyses are performed sequentially, so you can easily reproduce the results from the paper.

The repository includes the following files:

code_modeling.R: R script to run all the analyses
HtDP_functions.R: R functions used in the analyses
HtDP_functions.cpp: Rcpp functions used in the analyses
data: contains the datasets used in the analyses
If you have any questions or issues, please feel free to open an issue or contact us directly. We hope you find this repository useful and enjoy reproducing the results!
